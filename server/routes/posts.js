/**
 * PATCH VS PUT:
 *  For example, when you want to change the first name of a person in a database, you need to send the entire resource when making a PUT request.
 *  To make a PUT request, you need to send the two parameters; the first and the last name.
 * 
 *  Unlike PUT, PATCH applies a partial update to the resource.
 * This means that you are only required to send the data that you want to update, and it wonâ€™t affect or change anything else. So if you want to update the first    
 * name on a database, you will only be required to send the first parameter; the first name.
